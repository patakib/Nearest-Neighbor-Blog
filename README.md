### Hello World!

If you are learning Data Science, Machine Learning or interested in Python in general - I am your Nearest Neighbor. Let me introduce myself!
My name is Balint Pataki and I am an enthusiastic programmer mostly in Python with a focus for Data Science.
I am far from being a 10+ years experienced super-professional coding guy. Actually I have strong academic background both in engineering and in economics but not in IT (this is in progress, just for fun).
I have been working in data analysis for about 8 years in various topics from forestry and climate through procurement business and I picked up some coding skills along the way - and the journey still continues. As a lifelong-learner I'd like to share some ideas regarding data science, programming and self-teaching in the future.
Hope you'll enjoy it as well!
